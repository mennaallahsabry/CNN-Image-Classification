In this model, I use The CIFAR-10 dataset includses the classes 
Step 1 | Import Necessary Libraries (TensorFlow and Keras to handle the image data)
Step 2 | Data Preparation and Exploration (split  training data to training and validation sets)
Step 3 | Data Preprocessing 1)Normalization of Image Data :(convert the pixel values data type to float32 type, and then normalizes them by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the training set)
2)One-Hot Encoding of Labels: convert the class labels to one-hot vectors to transform the categorical labels into a format suitable
3)Data Augmentation :expand the size of the training set by creating modified versions of images in the dataset
Step 4 | Define CNN Model Architecture :It contains multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout layers, and finally a fully connected layer for classification.
Step 5 | Training the CNN Model The training uses a batch size of 64 and will run for a maximum of 100 epochs or until the early stopping condition is met. During the training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation data after each epoch
Step 6 | Visualizing the Learning Curves
Step 7 | Evaluating the Optimal Model on Test Data.
This steps represent the process in Model 1 
I share 3 differents models of CNN classifications that has explain the difference after experiment with various hyperparameters to optimize the model by changing the learning rate, numbers of layers, number of epochs, Dropout Rate, Batch Size
